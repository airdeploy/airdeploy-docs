### Description

This is the Airdeploy Documentation website project.

It's built on [Docusaurus](https://docusaurus.io) framework

`Master` branch is for the source files

`gh-pages` branch is for github pages branch. This branch is autogenerated by deploy command and must not be touched 
manually. It consists of html & css & js code

### Contribution 

#### Adding a new section

1. Create a file with .md extension and put it to the docs sub-folder you need. File header pattern:

```markdown

---
id: filename_without_extesion
title: title
sidebar_label: sidebar_label  
---
```

2. Update `website/sidebars.json` file with a reference to your new file 
3. Restart/`yarn start` from `website` dir to verify your changes, because you change the structure. You don't need to restart server when you are just editing a file
4. Create a PR to a `master` branch with the desired changes and request a review

### Developing

`cd website` 

There is a README.md file which describes on how to run docusaurus locally 

### Deploy

Right now publishing new version is done manually only via bash command using github pages

You must publish only `master` branch 

```commandline
cd website

GIT_USER=<GIT_USER> \
  CURRENT_BRANCH=master \
  USE_SSH=true \
  yarn run publish-gh-pages
```

This command will build html,css,js and push it to the `gh-pages` branch
