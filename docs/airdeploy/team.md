Each Airdeploy account comes with three team member seats. You may invite an unlimited number of team members, and your plan will scale (see more on pricing and plans on our website).

## Team Management

`Main Navigation > Choose Team`

### Inviting Team Members

- On the Team screen, click the “+”. A side panel will appear.
- Add one or more email addresses.
- Click “Send Invites”

Team members will be invited via email to join your organization (and to create an Airdeploy account if they don’t have one).

Team members who are invited appear in the “invited” list, along with the date. You can cancel an invitation by:

- Hovering over the Team member and clicking “X”
- Confirm the dialog warning to continue, or cancel to stop.

### Changing Team Member permissions
There are four levels of permissions:

- __Viewer__ — read-only access to Projects & Flags (and other stuff? Alvin)
- __Editor__ — previous permissions, plus Adding, Editing and deleting permissions.
- __Admin__ — previous permissions, plus Adding, Editing and deleting Team members, Billing, Etc(Alvin).
- __Owner__ — typically you, if you created the Organization.

For every Team member:

- Select a new permission from the dropdown for that user.
- The permission changes take effect immediately.

### Removing Team Members

- Hover over a Team member
- Click the “X”
- Confirm the dialog warning to continue, or cancel to stop.

## Team Flag Management

`Choose a Flag > Team, choose Manage Flag Team (a panel will appear)`

Once you add Team members to your organization, you can add them to individual Flags.

### Add a Team Member to a Flag

- Search for a Team member, or choose from the available list.
- Click on the Team member
- They are added to the Flag

### Remove a Team Member from a Flag
