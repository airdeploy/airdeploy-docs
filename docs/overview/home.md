Welcome to Airdeploy documentation. Airdeploy is a feature flagging library that routes traffic to features, and allows development teams to remotely launch, rollback, or toggle features on / off.

## Overview

Airdeploy consists of a dashboard and libraries in different languages:

- **Dashboard** - A UI for authoring / managing flags, and routing traffic
- **Live Updates** - Services for notifying clients (devices, browsers, etc.) of changes to any flags or rollouts
- **Flagger SDKs** - The SDK for integrating feature flags into apps
