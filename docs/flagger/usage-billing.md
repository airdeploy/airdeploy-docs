While there are basic initial plans, the main way you are billed by Airship is through usage. For specific details on current pricing and plan structures, see our website.

There are two dimensions of usage:

- __Sessions__ — when an actual Entity interacts with a Flag (not assignment, but the actual event).
- __Seats__ — the number of Team members joined to your organization.
