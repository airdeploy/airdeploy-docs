## Preparing your code
- Something about what to do with your feature code itself.
- Where you’re going to put the generated Airship code.

## Adding your first flag

Upon your first login, Airship starts with these defaults:

- One Organization
- One Project
- Two Environments

You will need to add:

- Entities
- Flags

You can always create additional:

- Organizations
- Projects
- Flags
- Environments
- Entities

New flags are added with these defaults:

- One Entity Type (“User” if available, otherwise the first Entity Type in your list).
- One Feature, defaulted “off”

## Your first (only) deploy

Unless you add new variations (or modify your feature code itself), you will not need to deploy this feature again to modify or use the Airship flag.
