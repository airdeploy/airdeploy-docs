## Glanceability

Airship is packed with data. There’s no end to the potential amount of data we could generate. There is a limit to how much someone can understand at any one time.

Our dashboards are visual enough to give you ample notice when something warrants you attention. Yet, when you get down to the details, those are there when you need them.

## Focus

As with all data, you want to see it in different forms and even edit and delete it at times. All those controls are there, but you don’t need them all at once.

We make use of hovering over elements to display those management functions when you need them. They don’t distract from getting a glanceable overview when you arrive (see what we did there?).

Additionally, we keep overall app navigation to a minimum and we segment tasks into individual views. Managing your team or configuring a flag are given full screen real estate so nothing else is a distraction.

## Efficiency

Being able to do what you want to do quickly and easily is efficiency. Sure, the details may be complex, but you shouldn’t have to cut into your productivity time with navigation.

Airship’s efficiency lies in its simple navigation structure and flag configuration. Drilling down into a flag is a hop away from any project screen. Switching environments happens right when you need it, whether managing flags, entities, or projects.

Contextual searching and convenient detail panels also enable an efficient workflow. These granular bits of data are necessary, but they are accessible as easily as if you were sitting in your easy chair reaching for a handful of chips.
