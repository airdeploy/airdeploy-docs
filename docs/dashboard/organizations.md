Organizations are workspaces for your team. A user can be part of multiple organizations. When you sign up for an Airdeploy account, if you are not joining an existing organization, your first organization is created for you.

## Switching Organizations

The organization menu allows you to switch your workspace to a different organization. To open the organization menu, find the organization name in the main navigation.

- **Your Organizations** — This is a list of organizations you either created or joined
- **Organizations You Can Join** — This is a list of organizations you are not a part of but can join.

Click an organization name to switch or join it.

## Creating Organizations

From the organization menu, you can create a new organization. Once on the Organization Switcher, click the “+”. A side panel will appear.

When creating a new organization, there are several options you can set:

- **Name** — What the organization is called
- **AKA** — A unique name (in case there are multiple organizations you've joined with the same name)
- **Open invitations** — You can enable open invitations, which allows any user with the same email domain to join this organization when they sign up for an Airdeploy account.

## Deleting Organizations

**Only the organization's owner can delete the organization** If you're not sure who the owner is, try checking the Team page.

- Locate the section “Danger Zone”
- Click the delete button that removes the organization
- Confirm the dialog warning to continue

Please note - deletion is permanent and removes all your projects and flags. Make sure you don't have any flags in your application that still depend on Airdeploy before continuing.
