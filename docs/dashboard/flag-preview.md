As you configure your flag, you may want to see how the entities be assigned. The flag preview page projects the flag's current configuration onto all known entities.

This panel will update in realtime as you modify entities, subsets, feature variations, and whitelisting.

The table on this page shows which variation each entity will be assigned (and whether the entity will receive the feature or not) before it occurs, along with the reason for the assignment.

You can search this list of known entities the double check the flag configuration or find out which variation any specific entity will be receiving.
