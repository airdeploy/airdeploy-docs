You can find your Team settings in the main navigation menu. From the Team settings page, you can set up how your team members will be able to work in Airdeploy. This page lists both existing team members as well as all the pending invitations that have been sent from your organization.

Team members will be invited via email to join your organization (and to create an Airdeploy account if they do not have one). You can cancel an invitation by removing the invitee from the "Pending Invitations" list.

## Setting Team Roles

This is also where the team's roles are set up. There are several roles in Airdeploy with different levels of permission:

| Permission                        | Owner | Admin | Editor | Viewer |
| --------------------------------- | :---: | :---: | :----: | :----: |
| View flags                        |   x   |   x   |   x    |   x    |
| Edit flags                        |   x   |   x   |   x    |        |
| Create / delete / archive flags   |   x   |   x   |   x    |        |
| Create / delete environments      |   x   |   x   |        |        |
| Create / delete projects          |   x   |   x   |        |        |
| Modify organization settings      |   x   |   x   |        |        |
| Update user roles                 |   x   |   x   |        |        |
| Delete users / revoke invitations |   x   |   x   |        |        |
| Update plans / billing info       |   x   |   x   |        |        |
| Delete organization               |   x   |       |        |        |

To update a user's role, select a new role from the dropdown next to each user's name.

> Only Admins and Owners can modify user roles. For everyone else, these roles are view only.

## Removing Team Members

Removing a team member does not delete the user's account, but remove them from the current organization.

- Find the team member
- Click the “X” by their name
- Confirm the dialog warning to continue
