Projects allow you to partition the flags and data that belong to an organization. This is useful for separating flags that belong to different applications, services, or clients.

When using the Airdeploy dashboard, your workspace is usually scoped to a particular project.

## Switching Projects

- Click on the project name in the main navigation
- From the dropdown, select the project you want to switch to

## Managing Projects

You can add and remove projects and environments (see [Environments](environments.md)). To view projects, find `Projects` in the main navigation menu under your organization.

This page lists all your active projects and their API keys.
