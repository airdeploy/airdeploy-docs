When you sign up for Airdeploy, an organization is created for you. This organization has three properties.

- __Name__ — What the organization is called
- __AKA__ —The code version of the name. __Editing the organization name requires a code change…__
- __Open invitations__ — this allows other Airdeploy users with the same domain to inherit this organization when they sign up or add this organization to their account.

You cannot delete this organization.

## Switching Organizations

`Main Navigation > Choose the Organization Name`

The switching menu allows you to change to a different organization, and interact with all its Projects, Environments, Flags, Entities, etc. There are two sections of the Switcher:

- __Your Organizations__ — This is a list of organizations you either created or joined
- __Organizations You Can Join__ — This is a list of organizations you are not a part of but can join.

Click an organization name to Switch or Join it.
