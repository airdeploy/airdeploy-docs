Airdeploy enables you to fine-tune your app with your users without continual redeployment. 

Within minutes of your first deployment, you can:

- Turn features on or off at will
- Target certain features to specific types of users
- Allow certain users to see specific features
- Restrict certain users from specific features

## What else can I use Airdeploy for?

These are just a few examples:

- You have a number of feature options and want to see which is more effective.
- You have certain content you want to serve to certain user groups.
